# Realistic Virtual Kaleidoscope
A dynamic and visually engaging virtual kaleidoscope created using Python and Pygame. This program mimics the reflective and symmetrical patterns seen in traditional kaleidoscopes, generating random shapes that rotate and reflect around a central point.

## Features
#### Symmetrical Reflections: Shapes and patterns are reflected symmetrically across multiple sections, replicating the behavior of a real kaleidoscope.
#### Dynamic Rotation: The entire canvas rotates smoothly, offering a mesmerizing visual experience.
#### Randomized Shapes and Colors: Each mouse click generates a new set of shapes and colors, keeping the visual output fresh and unpredictable.
#### User Interaction: Users can control the kaleidoscope by pausing the rotation with the spacebar and generating new patterns with a mouse click.

## How It Works
The program divides the canvas into 22 sections and populates each section with random shapes (circles, squares, and triangles) in various colors and sizes. These shapes are then mirrored across the sections to create a seamless kaleidoscope effect. The entire pattern rotates around the center of the canvas, mimicking the movement seen in physical kaleidoscopes.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required library by running:
```pip install pygame```

3. Clone the repository or download the script.
```python kaleidoscope.py```

## Usage
#### Generate New Patterns: Click anywhere on the canvas to generate a new set of random shapes and colors.
#### Pause/Resume Rotation: Press the spacebar to pause or resume the rotation.
